title: "A blended genome and exome sequencing method captures genetic variation in an unbiased, high-quality, and cost-effective manner"

excerpt: 'We deployed the Blended Genome Exome (BGE), a DNA library blending approach that generates low pass whole genome (1-4x mean depth) and deep whole exome (30-40x mean depth) data in a single sequencing run. This technology is cost-effective, empowers most genomic discoveries possible with deep whole genome sequencing, and provides an unbiased method to capture the diversity of common SNP variation across the globe. To evaluate this new technology at scale, we applied BGE to sequence >53,000 samples from the Populations Underrepresented in Mental Illness Associations Studies (PUMAS) Project, which included participants across African, African American, and Latin American populations.'
