title: "BioinformaticsBench: A collaboratively built large language model benchmark for Bioinformatics reasoning"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Most of the existing Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks on bioinformatics problem reasoning focus on problems grounded to niche research domains where datasets contain a small number of samples and, therefore are not truly representative of the broad domain of bioinformatics. To systematically examine the reasoning capabilities required for solving complex bioinformatics problems, we introduce an expansive benchmark suite BioinformaticsBench for LLMs. '
